## Advanced Lane Finding Report

In this project, I build a pipeline which can detect current lane of a car and compute the lane's area, curvature. The pipeline is robust enough such that it can perform well in various color and lighting conditions of roads and lane lines

My pipeline is composed by the following steps
    __1. Camera Calibration and Original Camera Image Undistortion__
    __2. Mixed Technique Binary Thresholding of Undistorted Image__
    __3. Bird View Perjection from Forward Facing Image__
    __4. Line Search and Second Order Curve Fitting__
    __5. Curvature Computation__
    __6. Project Results Back to Original Camera Image__
